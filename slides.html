## Goals for today

1. Tell you about my fisheries-based research.

2. Tell you about some of the big data products that I use (and are available to you too).

3. Get feedback and talk about possible collaborations.

# "Protecting marine mammals, turtles and birds by rebuilding global fisheries" 

## [Burgess, McDermott *et al*. (2018, *Science*)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aao4248)

---

## Fisheries bycatch as a dual conservation problem

- Problem 1: Many of the world's fisheries over overfished.

- Problem 2: Many marine species are threatened as fisheries bycatch (turtles, dolphins, etc.)

--

**Research question:** Can we solve Problem 1 by addressing Problem 2?

--

**Answer:** Yes! We consistently find that `\(\pm\)` 50% of the threatened bycatch species in our analysis recover as a collateral benefit of improved fisheries management.

## Quantifying trade-offs (summary)

![Fig 4.](pics/bycatch-fig-4.png)


---

## Summary

- Reforming global fisheries (to maximise profit!) goes a *long* way towards enabling recovery of threatened bycatch species; if not achieving it outright.
  - Results are surprisingly robust despite the many uncertainties involved. 

- At its heart, a classic environmental economics question about externalities.

- Paper builds on several other high-profile studies aimed at providing a clearer picture of global fisheries (e.g. [Costello *et al.*, *Science* 2012](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/09/26/science.1223389) ; [Costello *et al.*, *PNAS* 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/18/5125)).

# "The Blue Paradox: Preemptive Overfishing in Marine Reserves"

## [McDermott, Meng, *et al.* (2018, R&amp;R at *PNAS*)]()

---

## A marine reserve in real time

&lt;center&gt;

  &lt;source src="pics/pipa-zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;a href="http://globalfishingwatch.org/map/?redirect_login=true" target="_blank"&gt;Live session&lt;/a&gt;.
]

---

## Motivation

- People are very adept at anticipating policy changes.

- Preemptive responses can undermine desired policy goals.

- Well documented in other fields; gun control, Endangered Species Act, “green paradox”, etc.

- However, unknown whether same holds for large-scale marine conservation policies (data limitations a key reason).

--

**Research questions:**
1. Do fishers preemptively increase effort in anticipation of an impending marine reserve (i.e. a "blue paradox")? 
2. If yes, what are the consequences for science and policy?

???

- Blue paradox idea draws inspiration from the Green Paradox ([Sinn, 2012](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/green-paradox)) and related literature on preemptive habitat destruction under the E.S.A. ([Lueck and Michaels, 2003](http://www.masonlec.org/site/rte_uploads/files/Manne/2014.12.06/LueckMicheal_Class%208.pdf))

---

## Growth of MPAs (incl. marine reserves)

![](pics/mpas-culm.png)

---

## "Paper parks"

- Despite exponential growth in MPA coverage, conservation efficacy remains in question ([Edgar *at al*., 2014](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature13022.html); [Halpern, 2014](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature13053.html)).

- Numerous theories put forward (reserves too small, lack of budget for enforcement, etc.)

- Our suggestion: What about the behavioural / anticipatory response of fishermen?
  - A BP would also have important implications for how we should measure conservation efficacy in the first place. (More on this later.)

- But where to get data?..

--
  - Enter Global Fishing Watch.

???

- Edgar et al.'s five features: No take, well enforced, old (&gt;10 years), large (&gt;100km2), and isolated by deep water or sand.

---

## Global Fishing Watch

- GFW is a joint initiative between Google, SkyTruth and Oceana.

- Offers unprecented insight into *global* fishing activity.
  - Includes locations that were previously inaccesible to outside observers.
  
- Public dataset made available with the publication of [Kroodsma et al. (2018, *Science*)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/904): "Tracking the footprint of global fisheries".
  - GFW have made their data available in various forms ([GFW interactive map](http://globalfishingwatch.org/map/), [Google Earth Engine](http://globalfishingwatch.org/data-blog/our-data-in-earth-engine/), [Google BigQuery](http://jsmayorga.com/post/getting-global-fishing-watch-from-google-bigquery-using-r/)).

---

## Where does GFW get its data?

- Ships use AIS (Automatic Identification System) for maritime safety; broadcast location to navigate and avoid collisions.
  - Includes info on vessel ID, flag, speed, tonnage, etc. 
  - Problems: "Spoofing". Fields incorrectly entered by owner. Raw data contains many mistakes.

- Satellite and terrestrial systems can receive and record AIS messages too.

- AIS is BIG data... 
  - 22 billion messages from 250k industrial fishing vessels over 2012-2016.
  - 20 million messages being added *per day* (and growing).

???

- AIS is required on all vessels &gt;300 tons on international voyages. Many countries require smaller vessels to use AIS within their EEZs as well. 
- A moving vessel broadcasts a position message every 2 to 20 seconds 
- An anchored vessel every 3 to 6 minutes.
- GFW average is 50 satellite positions per vessel per day.

---

## Density of AIS

![](pics/ais-density.png)


---

## Processing and classifying the GFW data (1)

- Short version:&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Cloud computing and machine learning (convolutional neural network).
  1. Probability that a vessel *is* fishing, `\(P \in [0,1]\)`.
  2. What *type* of fishing is most likely (trawl, long line, purse sein, etc.)

- Training data: 240k hours' worth of AIS data from 624 vessels (569k AIS positions) that have been hand-labelled by fisheries experts and/or validated with logbook data.

.footnote[
[1] &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaehB3PJfr0" target="_blank"&gt;Lucius Fox&lt;/a&gt;: "I just wanted you to know how hard it was." 
]
  
???

- There are actually two CNNs:
  1. One to identify vessel characteristics, including length, engine power, and vessel type. (Training data: 73,994 vessels matched to official fleet registries, including about 13,500 fishing vessels.) 
  2. A second to detect which AIS positions were indicative of fishing activity. (Training data: 240,000 hours’ worth of AIS data, from 624 vessels, with over 569,000 AIS positions labelled by fisheries experts.)


---

## Processing and classifying the GFW data (2)

![](pics/gfw-train.gif)

---

## GFW dataset

- The cleaned GFW dataset contains 70k likely fishing vessels.
  - AIS-equipped vessels account for 75% of offshore fisheries (&gt;100 nm from land).

- Individual vessel tracts.
  - Where, when and for how long a vessel was fishing.
  - What type of fishing were they doing.

- Other covariates of interest: Flag, tonnage, length, speed, etc.

- [Explore the dataset](http://globalfishingwatch.org/map/).

???

- Small fraction of the world's ~2.5 million motorized fishing vessels... but it contains a majority of active vessels over 24 metres.

---

## Back to the Blue Paradox

- Focus on the Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA).
  - Part of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
  - One of the world's largest and most celebrated marine reserves.

- Identification: Spatial "difference-in-differences".
  - Compare fishing effort per km in neighbouring areas of the Kiribati EEZ: PIPA (treatment) vs non-PIPA (control).

- NB: Fishers have no incentive to lie about their position pre-enforcement.

## Extrapolating globally

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="pics/global_significance_colorblind.png" height="500px"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


---

## Conservation and science implications

BP has implications for both the conservation efficacy of marine reserves and the methods that scientists use to measure this efficacy. 

1. **Conservation efficacy**
  - Impoverished starting point for the affected reserves. 
  - Possible L-T declines (e.g. fish stocks pushed below min. population thresholds). 

2. **Scientific measurement** 
  - Simple comparison of fish abundance (e.g. before vs after) will be biased due to preemptive response.
  - Maybe we're mismeasuring the true effectiveness of these reserves?

---

## Summary

- Anticipation of PIPA causes fishing effort to more than double (↑ 130%).
  - Equivalent to 1.5 years of banned fishing.

- Extrapolating globally: Temporary ↑ in over-extracted fisheries from 65% to 72%.

- Reasons to view our empirical results as a lower bound.
  - E.g. Doesn’t account for long-term effects (population thresholds and other tipping points).

- BP offers a previously unexplored reason for prevalence of “paper parks”... And also has implications for ways that scientists measure their conservation efficacy.

???

Future research: Disentangling the exact mechanisms vis-a-vis property rights. Deeper dive into potential long-term ramifications.

---

## Other, ongoing GFW projects

- There are numerous other, ongoing GFW projects that I'd be happy to talk about afterwards.

  - Connecting overfishing and human-rights abuses on the high seas. (With Chris Costello and colleagues from UCSB and GFW.)
  - Trying to back out real-time stock assessments from GFW effort data. (Dan Ovando.)
  - Etc...

# Aquaculture mapping

## W.I.P. with various coauthors

---

## Aquaculture poised to overtake capture fisheries

![](pics/fao-aqua.jpg)

Source: 
&lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/3/I9540EN/i9540en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;FAO (2018)&lt;/a&gt;.

---

## Many unknowns

- Despite this incredible aggregate growth, many unknowns remain about aquaculture (mariculture)

- We don't even have a good sense of the true spatial footprint; how and where it is growing fastest.

- Nor, do we know much about how aquaculture and capture fisheries are interacting.
  - Complements? Competitors? Conservation tool? Habitat threat?

--

- **Idea:** Use high-resolution remote sensing (satellite) imagery and machine learning to map aquaculture at scale.

---

## Aside: Planetary-scale analysis w/ Google Earth Engine

- Google has done the hard work of ingesting (much of) the world's public satellite and remote sensing data.
  - Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, NOAA/NCEP/NCAR, etc.

- Paired with vast, colocated computational power.
  - "Bring your code to the data."

- Seemlessly interacts with many other products within the Google ecosystem.
  - GoogleDrive, Cloud storage, TensorFlow ML library, etc.

--

- I highly recommend applying for the annual GEE User Summit.

???

- 200 datasets, 5 million images (4k being added every day), 5 petabytes of data... 
- Automatic version control plus shareable scripts make for good research practice and reproducible science.

---

## GEE + ML aquaculture mapping example

- &lt;a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/83611acb2adbeed5fa0ac66a352a320a" target="_blank"&gt;Live session&lt;/a&gt;.

???

- FWIW, here's a GEE script for the &lt;a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/21c101d3d1aa7a5ac083c9bd6cd19f8c" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Paradox&lt;/a&gt; using GFW data.

---

## Summary

- Early results suggest that this approach is very promising.

- However, difficulties in scaling-up:
  - ML classification algorithms sensitive to even relatively small regional differences (ocean colour, aquaculture types, etc.)
  - Training the machine requires a *lot* of data (millions of data points).

- Near-term goal is to focus on a specific region, do that well, and possibly pair with GFW data to analyse interaction with capture fisheries.
